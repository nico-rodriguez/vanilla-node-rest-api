# Vanilla NodeJS CRUD REST API

## About

A full CRUD REST API implemented in bare-bones NodeJS (no framework like Express).

## Features

The endpoints are

- `GET /api/products`: get all products.
- `GET /api/products/:id`: get the product with `id` equal to `:id`.
- `POST /api/products`: create a new product (its `id` is generated by the server with `uuid`).
- `PUT /api/products/:id`: modify the product with `id` equal to `:id`.
- `DELETE /api/products/:id`: delete the product with `id` equal to `:id`.

There's a `test.rest` file for testing the endpoints. It works with the REST Client VSCode extension.

## Running

Clone the repo and run either `npm start` (or `npm run dev` for using `nodemon`).
